#
#   apply-pins.sh <findings-dir> <target-date>
#
# Reads two files from <findings-dir>:
#   pins.jsonl        one pin per line, written by L2:
#                     {"project","title","body","kind"}
#   pin-projects.tsv  project<TAB>cwd for every project this run triaged,
#                     written by run.sh. It is the authorization list: a pin
#                     naming any other project is refused.
#
# Each valid pin becomes one `shared-memory call mnemopi_remember`, scoped with
# --cwd to its project's working directory.
#
# Writes, inside <findings-dir>:
#   pins-applied.tsv  <sha1 of the canonical pin><TAB><memory_id> per stored
#                     pin. A pin already listed is skipped, so a rerun never
#                     stores the same memory twice. A failed call writes no row,
#                     so a rerun of the same date retries it. Nothing sweeps
#                     older dates yet (#69).
#   pins-result.txt   counters, one `key: value` per line.
#
# Exit 2 on bad arguments. Otherwise exit 0 whatever happened to the pins: a
# pin must never cost a report, and the counters say what went wrong.
#
# SHARED_MEMORY_BIN overrides the CLI (default: `shared-memory` on PATH). The
# test suite points it at a mock so no test writes real memory.
