# Issue #39 measurement: how long does a pasted X auth_token/ct0 pair actually last?
#
# The bookmark fetcher authenticates with cookies the user pastes by hand. Nobody knows
# whether re-pasting is a monthly chore or a yearly one, and that number decides whether
# automating the capture is worth its moving parts.
#
# Every night already leaves the evidence behind: findings/<date>/x-bookmarks.md carries a
# `# x-bookmarks: fetch failed — ...` header when the fetch broke, and names expired
# cookies specifically. This walks those files in date order and reports how many days ran
# between the first working night after a paste and the first night the cookies were
# rejected.
#
# It reads only artifacts. No model calls, no network, no credentials. Safe to re-run.
#
# Usage:
#   cookie-cadence.sh                       # every dated dir under the findings root
#   cookie-cadence.sh --days 30             # trailing 30
#   cookie-cadence.sh --quiet               # summary only, no per-date table
#
# Environment:
#   AUTODREAM_DIR  default: $HOME/.claude/autodream
