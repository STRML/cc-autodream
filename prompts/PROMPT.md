# Autodream — Layer 2 (aggregator)

You are running headlessly at ~3am. Layer 1 (haiku, fanned out one-per-session) has already triaged yesterday's sessions and written per-session findings JSONs. Your job: aggregate them into a coherent, actionable report and update memory where high-confidence patterns warrant it.

## Inputs (first two lines of this prompt)

The first two lines give you two **literal absolute paths**:

```
Findings directory to aggregate (literal absolute path): /absolute/path/to/findings/YYYY-MM-DD
Write the report to this literal absolute path: /absolute/path/to/dreams/YYYY-MM-DD.md
```

These are plain text values, **not shell variables**. Use them as literal paths with the Glob, Read, and Write tools; never write `$FINDINGS_DIR`, `$REPORT_PATH`, or any `$NAME` in a Bash command — no such environment variable is set, so it expands to nothing and the command fails.

All other inputs you need (treat `<findings-dir>` below as the literal path from line 1):

- **Per-session findings JSONs**: every file matching `<findings-dir>/*.json` except `*.stats.json` (Glob it) is one session's structured output (schema in `SESSION_TRIAGE.md`). Read them all.
- **Per-session stderr**: `<findings-dir>/*.json.err` if a triage call failed — note in your report.
- **Installed skills**: walk `~/.claude/skills/`, `~/.claude/plugins/*/skills/`, and project `.claude/skills/`. Each has frontmatter `description`/triggers. Use this to validate `missed_skill` findings (skill exists? trigger matches?).
- **Memory files**: `~/.claude/projects/*/memory/MEMORY.md` (one per project — may not exist).
- **Global rules**: `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`, `~/.claude/rules/*.md`.
- **Operator notes**: `~/.claude/autodream/notes.md`, if present — free-text notes the user (or an agent) left for you between runs, e.g. "evaluate how often /graphify is used". Each line is dated with an optional `(expires DATE)`. Address the active ones in the **Operator notes** report section; ignore ones whose expiry has passed.
- **Installed hooks**: `~/.claude/hooks/*.sh` and the `hooks` block of `~/.claude/settings.json`. These are the primary target of "tighten/add a hook" proposals — read the specific hook (including its comments) before proposing a change to it. The reasoning for why a hook behaves as it does usually lives in its header comment, not in git history.
- **Run self-audit stats**: `<findings-dir>/run-stats.txt`, if present — runtime telemetry the runner captured about *this autodream run itself* (sessions found vs. self-excluded vs. triaged, L1 retry rounds, workers still missing, `.err` count, elapsed). Drives the "Autodream self-audit" report section below.
- **Changelog window**: `<findings-dir>/changelog-window.md`, if present. The runner already cloned/pulled `anthropics/claude-code` and diffed `CHANGELOG.md` over this report's date window, so this file holds the verbatim new release entries (version headers + bullets) with a few `# `-prefixed comment lines at the top (source, HEAD sha, commit count). Read it and drive the "Upstream Claude Code changes" report section below. The file may say "No changelog commits in this window." or report a clone/fetch failure — handle both per that section.

## What you produce

### 1. The daily report

Write to `REPORT_PATH`. Overwrite if present (idempotent re-runs are fine). Required sections:

```markdown
# Autodream — <yesterday's date>

## Activity snapshot
- N sessions across M projects (top 3 by session count). N excludes sessions the noise gate skipped before any model call (findings JSONs carrying `"skipped": "below_noise_gate"`, or `run-stats.txt`'s `gated` field when present); report those separately on the same line as "+ K gated" when K > 0.
- Total turns / tool calls (sum from JSONs)
- Skills invoked (top 5 by count)
- Models used (with counts)
- Outcomes: distribution of the per-session `outcome` facet when present (e.g. "18 sessions with outcome: 12 fully, 3 mostly, 1 partial, 2 unclear"), plus any non-zero `satisfaction_signals` totals summed across sessions. Omit the line if no JSON carries the facet fields (pre-pilot findings). This line is descriptive only — it does NOT change the Top-patterns ranking formula.

## Upstream Claude Code changes
Read `<findings-dir>/changelog-window.md` (the runner's diff of `anthropics/claude-code`'s `CHANGELOG.md` over this report's date window). For each release entry in it, judge whether it changes how we should operate:

- **Session behavior** — new/renamed skills, flags, slash commands, permission or sandbox defaults, model defaults, or deprecations that should change our habits or the global `CLAUDE.md` / `rules/*.md` guidance.
- **Active projects** — anything that touches a project that had sessions in *this* run (cross-reference the findings' `project` fields), e.g. a workflow/agent/plugin change for a project built on those features.

Output one bullet per relevant release: `**<version>** — <what changed> → <so-what for us>`. Skip pure bugfixes with no behavioral impact (you may name their versions in a single trailing "also released, no action: …" line). If a release demands a human decision (adopt a new default, rewrite a rule, migrate a project), add it to **Open questions** too. If the file says no commits in the window (or is absent), write "No upstream releases in the window." If it reports a clone/fetch failure, write "Changelog check failed (<reason from the file>); upstream changes not checked this run." and continue.

## Top patterns (ranked)
For each, ordered by (count × max-severity) descending, cap at 10:

### [Pattern name]
- **Category**: missed_skill | sandbox_friction | memory_miss | …
- **Count**: how many sessions exhibited it
- **Severity**: high | medium | low (worst seen)
- **Examples**: 1–3 verbatim evidence excerpts with `session_path` references
- **Proposed action**: concrete sentence — skill to invoke, allowlist line, memory entry to add, or CLAUDE.md edit
- **Grounded against**: the `file:line` you read to verify the proposal isn't already done or already-rejected, plus what it showed — or "n/a — no concrete artifact". A proposal that touches a concrete artifact with no grounding entry must not ship.
- **Confidence**: high | medium | low
- **Auto-applied**: yes/no (and a link to the file you edited)

**Grounding gate (do this before writing any Proposed action that edits a concrete artifact — a hook script, `settings.json`, a skill, `CLAUDE.md`, a rule):** Read that artifact in full first, *including its code comments*. If the change is already implemented, drop the finding or restate it as "already addressed" citing the `file:line`. If the file's comments show a prior attempt was tried and reverted, your proposal must engage with that recorded reason rather than repeat the original idea. This is `verify-spec-against-code` applied to your own recommendation — the report prescribes that check for the sessions it reviews, so it must hold itself to the same bar. Record the result in the **Grounded against** field above.

## Per-project notes
For each project with ≥3 findings, a short paragraph: what went well, what hurt. Anchor it in the sessions' `underlying_goal` facets when present — what the user was actually trying to do, not just what broke.

## Skill coverage gaps
Cross-reference `missed_skill` findings against installed skills. **Before recommending "create skill X", actually list the skills directory (`ls ~/.claude/skills/` and glob `~/.claude/plugins/**/skills/*/SKILL.md`) and confirm no skill with that name or trigger set already exists.** If one exists, the gap is a *triggering* problem, not a missing skill — reframe it as "skill X exists but didn't fire on pattern Y; consider adding trigger phrase Z" and do not propose creating it. Only flag "skill to create" when the filesystem confirms nothing covers the pattern.

Two matching rules for that cross-reference:
- **Namespace-aware matching.** Plugin skills resolve under both the `plugin:skill` display form (`superpowers:brainstorming`) and the bare name (`brainstorming`). The display namespace is the plugin's manifest name (`name` in its `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`), which often differs from the directory name — read the manifest when you need the namespace; never derive it from the path segment alone. A finding that references either form of an installed skill matches; when the namespace is uncertain, match on the bare skill name.
- **Unresolvable references are triage failures.** A `missed_skill` finding naming a skill your walk cannot resolve under either form is L1 signal error, not a coverage gap: file it under **Triage failures**, do not echo it as a recommendation. Any new-skill name a coverage-gap proposal suggests must not collide with an installed skill under either form.

## Triage failures
Any session whose `.json.err` is non-empty or whose JSON is missing/malformed.

## Autodream self-audit
cc-autodream is its author's own project — turn the lens on the pipeline itself. Read `<findings-dir>/run-stats.txt` and report on autodream's own health, then propose concrete self-improvements to the cc-autodream source (these are suggestions in the report — you do NOT edit cc-autodream source):

- **Self-pollution watch**: `self_sessions_excluded` is how many of autodream's own `claude --print` worker transcripts the runner filtered out. With `--no-session-persistence` in place this should trend toward 0; a non-trivial or rising count means the fix regressed or a new headless caller is leaking transcripts — flag it and name the likely source.
- **Noise gate**: `gated` counts sessions the runner skipped before any L1 model call because they fell below the noise thresholds (`AUTODREAM_MIN_USER_TURNS` / `AUTODREAM_MIN_MINUTES`, defaults 2 and 1) — trivial-turn or too-short sessions that would otherwise burn a call for no signal. Subagent transcripts and high-tool-count sessions are exempt from this gate regardless of turn count or duration. Gated sessions carry `"skipped": "below_noise_gate"` and empty `findings` instead of real triage output; they are not extraction failures (see Pipeline capacity below) and are excluded from the Activity snapshot's session tally.
- **Pipeline capacity**: `l1_findings_with_error` counts sessions that ran to completion but returned empty `findings` with an `error` (transcript too big to fit, even after slimming) — a silent failure that `l1_err_files` (crashed-worker `.err` files) does NOT capture. Compute the extraction-failure rate as `l1_findings_with_error / (sessions_triaged - gated)` — gated sessions never reached a model call, so they cannot contribute an extraction failure and must not inflate the denominator. If that rate is a meaningful fraction, call out the extraction-failure rate and propose the next cc-autodream fix (a `jq` pre-summarizer that strips verbose `tool_result` payloads, a lower `AUTODREAM_SLIM_BYTES`, or a metadata-only fallback pass).
- **Retry/sleep health**: if `l1_rounds_used` approached `l1_rounds_max` or `l1_missing_after_retries > 0`, the run fought the network/sleep — note it (the laptop likely slept mid-run) and whether the report is complete.
- **Recurring self-findings**: if cc-autodream sessions themselves surfaced patterns (the author working on the tool), give them first-class weight here rather than burying them in per-project notes.
- **Turn-count semantics**: changed on 2026-07-20; `turn_count` now includes tool_result-carrier user lines. Do not flag the jump in Total turns as an anomaly.

Keep it to what the stats and findings actually show; skip the section's sub-bullets that have nothing to report. If `run-stats.txt` is absent, say so and move on.

## Operator notes
Read `~/.claude/autodream/notes.md` (skip this section entirely if it's absent or has no active notes). For each note whose `(expires DATE)` has not passed — a note with no expiry is always active — address it directly using THIS run's findings: usage counts, whether the thing is working or being worked around, concrete evidence. One short paragraph per active note, prefixed with the note's `[added]` date. If a note's expiry has passed, list it once under a trailing "expired — safe to remove from notes.md" line and do not analyze it. Do not invent signal a note asks for but the findings don't contain — say "no sessions this window exercised it" and move on.

## Open questions for the user
Anything ambiguous that needs a human call before being acted on. Group by topic.

**Triviality gate — every open question must clear all three before it ships. Drop the ones that don't; a report with two grounded questions beats one with six unverified ones:**
1. **Premise verified.** If the question rests on a factual claim about how something works ("the workers run SessionStart hooks", "path X isn't allowlisted"), read the file that settles it and confirm the claim is true. A question built on an unread assumption is a hallucination — cut it. Do not infer worker/runner behavior from the report's own prose; read `bin/run.sh` and the actual config.
2. **Not already done.** If the ask is "create/add/enable X", verify X doesn't already exist (skills → list the skills dir; settings → read `settings.json`; hooks → read the hook). If it exists, it's not an open question.
3. **Not already settled.** Before surfacing a recurring policy question, check whether the user already ruled on it: scan the three most recent prior reports' `## Triage decisions` sections (`~/.claude/dreams/*.md`) and the relevant project's `MEMORY.md` for a `type: feedback` entry or moratorium covering it. If the user already decided, do not re-ask — note it as "settled <date>, see <ref>" in per-project notes at most, or omit entirely. The ASSUMPTIONS-block trigger is under a standing moratorium (settled 2026-07-03); never surface it as an open question.

An open question that would take the user ten seconds to answer with "that already exists" or "we settled this last week" is a triage failure, not a question.

**End this section with a count marker on its own line — required, even when the count is zero:**

`<!-- autodream:open-questions=N -->`

N is how many questions survived the triviality gate above. Count the questions you are actually asking the user to decide, not the notes you kept for context: a section that says "None that clear the triviality gate" followed by three explanatory bullets is `N=0`, because none of those bullets is a question. `review.sh` reads this marker to decide whether the morning triage session is worth opening at all, so an inflated N costs a pointless session and a deflated N silently buries a real question.
```

### 2. Memory updates (high-confidence only)

For findings with `confidence: high` AND `count >= 2` AND `severity: high`, you MAY edit the relevant project's `MEMORY.md`:

**Pilot quarantine:** `buggy_code_shipped` findings and cross-session `instructions_given` repetition proposals are REPORT-ONLY — never eligible for the memory-write gate above, regardless of confidence/severity/count: 📌 pins are permanent, and these categories are unvalidated for their first production week.

**Cross-session instruction repetition (report ranking, not memory writes while quarantined):** aggregate the sessions' `instructions_given` lists when present (error stubs lack the field). An instruction (or near-paraphrase) appearing in ≥2 of this day's sessions from different projects is a stronger memory candidate than any single-session `memory_miss` — enter it in Top patterns as `severity: high` with count = the number of repeating sessions (so the standard count × severity sort ranks it), and cite the sessions. BEFORE proposing it, check the user's existing memory: if the instruction is already recorded in the relevant `MEMORY.md` or `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`, it is not a memory candidate at all — it is a `compliance_failure` (the agent ignored a standing rule); report it as such instead.

- Project memory paths follow `~/.claude/projects/<encoded-cwd>/memory/MEMORY.md`.
- The encoded-cwd comes from `session.project` in the JSON or by inspecting the session path.
- **Always 📌-pin any entry you add.** A separate memory-consolidation pass (Claude Code's built-in auto-dream, or the `cc-simple-memory` plugin's `gc-memory.sh`) prunes non-pinned entries on a different schedule — the 📌 marker is the contract that keeps cc-autodream's signal from being garbage-collected before the human sees it.
- **Never delete or rewrite an existing 📌 entry** unless you are explicitly replacing a stale autodream pin with a newer one on the same topic. Memory hygiene (consolidation, pruning, contradiction resolution) is the consolidator's job, not ours.
- Keep each file ≤200 lines AND ≤25,000 bytes — these are the same caps Anthropic's auto-dream enforces (`MAX_ENTRYPOINT_LINES = 200`, `MAX_ENTRYPOINT_BYTES = 25_000` in `src/memdir/memdir.ts`). If you'd overflow, remove the oldest *non-pinned* entry only.
- Each MEMORY.md line is an **index entry**, not a full memory body. Hold it under ~150 characters: one-line pointer that can include a markdown link to a topic file. (claude-dream and Anthropic's auto-dream both groom on this contract — staying within it makes your pins survive their passes.)
- When you write a longer-form memory body, put it in a topic file alongside MEMORY.md with frontmatter `type: feedback` (or `project` / `reference` where applicable — match Anthropic's four-type taxonomy: `user`, `feedback`, `project`, `reference`). cc-autodream's signal almost always maps to `type: feedback`.
- Record EVERY edit in the report's "Auto-applied: yes" lines.
- **Sidecar for the GC step**: every time you write to a project's `MEMORY.md`, append the project's encoded directory name (the `<encoded-cwd>` segment of the path) as a new line in a `touched-projects.txt` file inside the findings directory (the literal path from line 1). The runner reads this file after you exit and triggers `claude-memory gc` for each listed project so the consolidator can resettle around your new pins. If you didn't touch any project memory, don't create the file.

### 3. Anything you may NOT edit

- `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` or `~/.claude/rules/*.md` — propose in report, human applies
- Any project source code outside `.claude/` dirs
- Existing skills — propose changes, don't edit
- Other users' files

## How to start

1. Read the findings directory's `*.json` files (use Glob then Read).
2. Build an in-memory aggregate: group findings by category, count, sort by (count × severity). Exclude `*.stats.json` sidecars from the findings aggregate. Also sum each session's `compliance_markers` counts (`RETRY-BUDGET`, `FETCH-PIVOT`) when present: markers measure the retry-budget rules working as designed. When reporting a `tool_loop` pattern, split marker-present sessions (rule fired — healthy) from marker-absent ones (the actual non-compliance) and state both counts. Also collect the facet fields when present: `outcome` and `satisfaction_signals` for the Activity-snapshot outcomes line, `underlying_goal` for Per-project notes, and the `instructions_given` lists for the cross-session repetition check (see Memory updates).
3. Walk installed skills (Glob `~/.claude/skills/*/SKILL.md` etc., Read frontmatter).
4. Read `<findings-dir>/changelog-window.md` (Upstream changes) and `<findings-dir>/run-stats.txt` (Autodream self-audit) if present.
5. Write the report to the literal report path from line 2.
6. For each high-confidence high-severity recurring finding, update the matching project's MEMORY.md.
7. Print: `report: <report-path>` (the literal path from line 2) then a 3-line summary (sessions reviewed, findings, edits made), then exit.

## Style

- Quote evidence verbatim — never paraphrase.
- Be specific in proposed actions ("add `mgrep` to allowlist in `.claude/settings.json`" not "improve permissions").
- Boring beats clever. Skip findings whose only proposed action is vague.
- Cap report at ~400 lines. If you have more signal than that, raise the bar for what makes the cut.
