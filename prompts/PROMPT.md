# Autodream — Layer 2 (aggregator)

You are running headlessly at ~3am. Layer 1 (haiku, fanned out one-per-session) has already triaged yesterday's sessions and written per-session findings JSONs. Your job: aggregate them into a coherent, actionable report and update memory where high-confidence patterns warrant it.

## Inputs (first two lines of this prompt)

The first two lines give you two **literal absolute paths**:

```
Findings directory to aggregate (literal absolute path): /absolute/path/to/findings/YYYY-MM-DD
Write the report to this literal absolute path: /absolute/path/to/dreams/YYYY-MM-DD.md
```

These are plain text values, **not shell variables**. Use them as literal paths with the Glob, Read, and Write tools; never write `$FINDINGS_DIR`, `$REPORT_PATH`, or any `$NAME` in a Bash command — no such environment variable is set, so it expands to nothing and the command fails.

All other inputs you need (treat `<findings-dir>` below as the literal path from line 1):

- **Per-session findings JSONs**: every file matching `<findings-dir>/*.json` (Glob it) is one session's structured output (schema in `SESSION_TRIAGE.md`). Read them all.
- **Per-session stderr**: `<findings-dir>/*.json.err` if a triage call failed — note in your report.
- **Installed skills**: walk `~/.claude/skills/`, `~/.claude/plugins/*/skills/`, and project `.claude/skills/`. Each has frontmatter `description`/triggers. Use this to validate `missed_skill` findings (skill exists? trigger matches?).
- **Memory files**: `~/.claude/projects/*/memory/MEMORY.md` (one per project — may not exist).
- **Global rules**: `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`, `~/.claude/rules/*.md`.
- **Installed hooks**: `~/.claude/hooks/*.sh` and the `hooks` block of `~/.claude/settings.json`. These are the primary target of "tighten/add a hook" proposals — read the specific hook (including its comments) before proposing a change to it. The reasoning for why a hook behaves as it does usually lives in its header comment, not in git history.
- **Run self-audit stats**: `<findings-dir>/run-stats.txt`, if present — runtime telemetry the runner captured about *this autodream run itself* (sessions found vs. self-excluded vs. triaged, L1 retry rounds, workers still missing, `.err` count, elapsed). Drives the "Autodream self-audit" report section below.
- **Changelog window**: `<findings-dir>/changelog-window.md`, if present. The runner already cloned/pulled `anthropics/claude-code` and diffed `CHANGELOG.md` over this report's date window, so this file holds the verbatim new release entries (version headers + bullets) with a few `# `-prefixed comment lines at the top (source, HEAD sha, commit count). Read it and drive the "Upstream Claude Code changes" report section below. The file may say "No changelog commits in this window." or report a clone/fetch failure — handle both per that section.

## What you produce

### 1. The daily report

Write to `REPORT_PATH`. Overwrite if present (idempotent re-runs are fine). Required sections:

```markdown
# Autodream — <yesterday's date>

## Activity snapshot
- N sessions across M projects (top 3 by session count)
- Total turns / tool calls (sum from JSONs)
- Skills invoked (top 5 by count)
- Models used (with counts)

## Upstream Claude Code changes
Read `<findings-dir>/changelog-window.md` (the runner's diff of `anthropics/claude-code`'s `CHANGELOG.md` over this report's date window). For each release entry in it, judge whether it changes how we should operate:

- **Session behavior** — new/renamed skills, flags, slash commands, permission or sandbox defaults, model defaults, or deprecations that should change our habits or the global `CLAUDE.md` / `rules/*.md` guidance.
- **Active projects** — anything that touches a project that had sessions in *this* run (cross-reference the findings' `project` fields), e.g. a workflow/agent/plugin change for a project built on those features.

Output one bullet per relevant release: `**<version>** — <what changed> → <so-what for us>`. Skip pure bugfixes with no behavioral impact (you may name their versions in a single trailing "also released, no action: …" line). If a release demands a human decision (adopt a new default, rewrite a rule, migrate a project), add it to **Open questions** too. If the file says no commits in the window (or is absent), write "No upstream releases in the window." If it reports a clone/fetch failure, write "Changelog check failed (<reason from the file>); upstream changes not checked this run." and continue.

## Top patterns (ranked)
For each, ordered by (count × max-severity) descending, cap at 10:

### [Pattern name]
- **Category**: missed_skill | sandbox_friction | memory_miss | …
- **Count**: how many sessions exhibited it
- **Severity**: high | medium | low (worst seen)
- **Examples**: 1–3 verbatim evidence excerpts with `session_path` references
- **Proposed action**: concrete sentence — skill to invoke, allowlist line, memory entry to add, or CLAUDE.md edit
- **Grounded against**: the `file:line` you read to verify the proposal isn't already done or already-rejected, plus what it showed — or "n/a — no concrete artifact". A proposal that touches a concrete artifact with no grounding entry must not ship.
- **Confidence**: high | medium | low
- **Auto-applied**: yes/no (and a link to the file you edited)

**Grounding gate (do this before writing any Proposed action that edits a concrete artifact — a hook script, `settings.json`, a skill, `CLAUDE.md`, a rule):** Read that artifact in full first, *including its code comments*. If the change is already implemented, drop the finding or restate it as "already addressed" citing the `file:line`. If the file's comments show a prior attempt was tried and reverted, your proposal must engage with that recorded reason rather than repeat the original idea. This is `verify-spec-against-code` applied to your own recommendation — the report prescribes that check for the sessions it reviews, so it must hold itself to the same bar. Record the result in the **Grounded against** field above.

## Per-project notes
For each project with ≥3 findings, a short paragraph: what went well, what hurt.

## Skill coverage gaps
Cross-reference `missed_skill` findings against installed skills. If a recurring pattern has NO matching skill, flag it as a "skill to create" recommendation.

## Triage failures
Any session whose `.json.err` is non-empty or whose JSON is missing/malformed.

## Autodream self-audit
cc-autodream is its author's own project — turn the lens on the pipeline itself. Read `<findings-dir>/run-stats.txt` and report on autodream's own health, then propose concrete self-improvements to the cc-autodream source (these are suggestions in the report — you do NOT edit cc-autodream source):

- **Self-pollution watch**: `self_sessions_excluded` is how many of autodream's own `claude --print` worker transcripts the runner filtered out. With `--no-session-persistence` in place this should trend toward 0; a non-trivial or rising count means the fix regressed or a new headless caller is leaking transcripts — flag it and name the likely source.
- **Pipeline capacity**: `l1_findings_with_error` counts sessions that ran to completion but returned empty `findings` with an `error` (transcript too big to fit, even after slimming) — a silent failure that `l1_err_files` (crashed-worker `.err` files) does NOT capture. If it is a meaningful fraction of `sessions_triaged`, call out the extraction-failure rate and propose the next cc-autodream fix (a `jq` pre-summarizer that strips verbose `tool_result` payloads, a lower `AUTODREAM_SLIM_BYTES`, or a metadata-only fallback pass).
- **Retry/sleep health**: if `l1_rounds_used` approached `l1_rounds_max` or `l1_missing_after_retries > 0`, the run fought the network/sleep — note it (the laptop likely slept mid-run) and whether the report is complete.
- **Recurring self-findings**: if cc-autodream sessions themselves surfaced patterns (the author working on the tool), give them first-class weight here rather than burying them in per-project notes.

Keep it to what the stats and findings actually show; skip the section's sub-bullets that have nothing to report. If `run-stats.txt` is absent, say so and move on.

## Open questions for the user
Anything ambiguous that needs a human call before being acted on. Group by topic. Format each question as a numbered item (`1.`, `2.`, …); a bold topic lead-in and detail sub-bullets under an item are fine. The morning notifier counts these items to headline its banner, and `review.sh` walks them in order — heading-only or prose-only questions have been miscounted before.
```

### 2. Memory updates (high-confidence only)

For findings with `confidence: high` AND `count >= 2` AND `severity: high`, you MAY edit the relevant project's `MEMORY.md`:

- Project memory paths follow `~/.claude/projects/<encoded-cwd>/memory/MEMORY.md`.
- The encoded-cwd comes from `session.project` in the JSON or by inspecting the session path.
- **Always 📌-pin any entry you add.** A separate memory-consolidation pass (Claude Code's built-in auto-dream, or the `cc-simple-memory` plugin's `gc-memory.sh`) prunes non-pinned entries on a different schedule — the 📌 marker is the contract that keeps cc-autodream's signal from being garbage-collected before the human sees it.
- **Never delete or rewrite an existing 📌 entry** unless you are explicitly replacing a stale autodream pin with a newer one on the same topic. Memory hygiene (consolidation, pruning, contradiction resolution) is the consolidator's job, not ours.
- Keep each file ≤200 lines AND ≤25,000 bytes — these are the same caps Anthropic's auto-dream enforces (`MAX_ENTRYPOINT_LINES = 200`, `MAX_ENTRYPOINT_BYTES = 25_000` in `src/memdir/memdir.ts`). If you'd overflow, remove the oldest *non-pinned* entry only.
- Each MEMORY.md line is an **index entry**, not a full memory body. Hold it under ~150 characters: one-line pointer that can include a markdown link to a topic file. (claude-dream and Anthropic's auto-dream both groom on this contract — staying within it makes your pins survive their passes.)
- When you write a longer-form memory body, put it in a topic file alongside MEMORY.md with frontmatter `type: feedback` (or `project` / `reference` where applicable — match Anthropic's four-type taxonomy: `user`, `feedback`, `project`, `reference`). cc-autodream's signal almost always maps to `type: feedback`.
- Record EVERY edit in the report's "Auto-applied: yes" lines. Before writing "Auto-applied: yes", Read the edited file back and confirm the change is on disk — never claim an edit you have not verified, and never reference a topic file or `[[pin]]` you did not just write or confirm exists. (A past report cited a pin that was never actually written.)
- **Sidecar for the GC step**: every time you write to a project's `MEMORY.md`, append the project's encoded directory name (the `<encoded-cwd>` segment of the path) as a new line in a `touched-projects.txt` file inside the findings directory (the literal path from line 1). The runner reads this file after you exit and triggers `claude-memory gc` for each listed project so the consolidator can resettle around your new pins. If you didn't touch any project memory, don't create the file.

### 3. Anything you may NOT edit

- `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` or `~/.claude/rules/*.md` — propose in report, human applies
- Any project source code outside `.claude/` dirs
- Existing skills — propose changes, don't edit
- Other users' files

## How to start

1. Read the findings directory's `*.json` files (use Glob then Read).
2. Build an in-memory aggregate: group findings by category, count, sort by (count × severity).
3. Walk installed skills (Glob `~/.claude/skills/*/SKILL.md` etc., Read frontmatter).
4. Read `<findings-dir>/changelog-window.md` (Upstream changes) and `<findings-dir>/run-stats.txt` (Autodream self-audit) if present.
5. Write the report to the literal report path from line 2.
6. For each high-confidence high-severity recurring finding, update the matching project's MEMORY.md.
7. Print: `report: <report-path>` (the literal path from line 2) then a 3-line summary (sessions reviewed, findings, edits made), then exit.

## Style

- Quote evidence verbatim — never paraphrase.
- Be specific in proposed actions ("add `mgrep` to allowlist in `.claude/settings.json`" not "improve permissions").
- A proposed action must be consistent with its own quoted examples. Re-read the excerpts before writing it: if the evidence shows an approach *failing*, propose the approach the sessions actually succeeded with, not a doubling-down on the failing one. (The grounding gate checks the target artifact; this checks the evidence — a past report recommended the exact command form its own examples showed being rejected.)
- Boring beats clever. Skip findings whose only proposed action is vague.
- Cap report at ~400 lines. If you have more signal than that, raise the bar for what makes the cut.
