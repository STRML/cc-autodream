# Changelog

All notable changes to cc-autodream. Format loosely follows Keep a Changelog.

## 2026-07-09

### Changed
- **notify.sh is editor-agnostic.** Sublime Text is no longer hardcoded: the notification click action and the direct open both run `$AUTODREAM_OPEN` (a `sh -c` snippet, so flags work — `subl`, `code -g`, `open -a Obsidian`), defaulting to plain `open`, which hands the inbox file to the user's default `.md` app. The Sublime auto-probe chain is gone; `SUBL` is still honored as a deprecated alias for existing setups. New `test_notify_open` covers word-splitting, the click action, and the alias.

## 2026-07-07

### Fixed
- **notify.sh counts questions, not list lines.** The single-pass marker grep overcounted (detail sub-bullets under a numbered item or bold title each counted as a question) and counted zero on a prose-only section, silently skipping the morning pop. The counter now takes the first format tier that matches — numbered items, then bold titles, then bullets — and treats any other non-empty section as one question, so a non-empty "Open questions" section always pops. New `test_notify` covers all five observed formats offline (a pre-seeded dummy branded notifier keeps real banners from posting during tests).
- **PROMPT.md guardrails from a 2026-07-05 triage.** (a) Open questions must be numbered items — pins the format the notifier counts and `review.sh` walks; (b) proposed actions must be consistent with their own quoted evidence — a report recommended the exact command form its examples showed being rejected (complements the grounding gate, which checks the target artifact rather than the evidence); (c) "Auto-applied: yes" may only be written after Reading the edited file back — a report cited a memory pin that was never actually written.
- **Grounding gate must read the edit target, not just a related artifact.** A 2026-07-06 report grounded a missed_skill proposal against the skill's frontmatter but never read the project `CLAUDE.md` it proposed to edit — which documented the flagged behavior as intentional protocol (subagents run gates manually; the controller owns the commit-bundled skill). The gate now names the edit target + governing project CLAUDE.md as the required reads and adds a "working as documented → false positive" outcome.

## [Unreleased] — 2026-05-30

### Added
- **On-demand runner (`bin/autodream-now.sh`).** Runs the pipeline NOW via a transient one-shot launchd agent, so it survives the ~10-minute cap on Claude Code background Bash tasks (and ssh disconnects) — launchd owns the process, no time cap. `[DATE] [--force] [--watch] [--dry-run]`. Auto-detects everything: resolves its own symlink to find `run.sh`, picks the scheduled plist whose `ProgramArguments` reference `run.sh` (not the sibling `*-review` job) for its label namespace, and detects uid + `claude`/`git` dirs for the agent PATH. `RunAtLoad` is the only trigger (no `kickstart`, so a fast idempotency no-op can't double-run). Never touches the scheduled nightly job. `install.sh` symlinks it alongside the others.
- **Upstream changelog awareness.** `run.sh` clones/pulls `anthropics/claude-code` into a persistent cache and diffs `CHANGELOG.md` over the run's date window (by real commit date, since the raw changelog carries no dates but the git history does). Layer 2 reads the result and writes an "Upstream Claude Code changes" report section flagging releases that change how we work or affect active projects. Degrades gracefully with no git/network. Knobs: `AUTODREAM_CHANGELOG`, `CLAUDE_CODE_REPO`, `CHANGELOG_REMOTE`.
- **Self-pollution prevention.** Both layers now pass `--no-session-persistence`, so `claude --print` workers no longer leave their own transcripts in `~/.claude/projects/` for the next run to re-triage (this had been ~90% of the corpus). New `bin/prune-self-sessions.sh` is the single source of truth for the "is this autodream's own session?" predicate: lists them, `--delete` purges the backlog, `--filter` excludes them. `run.sh` enumeration pipes through `--filter` so pre-fix transcripts are never triaged.
- **Sleep-resilient retry.** `run.sh` retries L1 over only the still-missing sessions across network/sleep gaps (`AUTODREAM_L1_ROUNDS`, `wait_for_network`), retries L2 until a report lands (`AUTODREAM_L2_ATTEMPTS`), and short-circuits via an idempotency guard when a report already exists (`AUTODREAM_FORCE=1` to rebuild). The launchd example now schedules several morning catch-up triggers and documents a `pmset` scheduled wake.
- **Autodream self-audit.** `run.sh` writes `run-stats.txt` (sessions found/excluded/triaged, L1 rounds/done/missing/err, elapsed). A new PROMPT.md "Autodream self-audit" section turns the lens on the pipeline: it flags self-pollution regressions, pipeline-capacity issues (oversized transcripts), and retry/sleep health, and proposes concrete cc-autodream source fixes since the user authors the tool.
- **Oversized-transcript slimming.** New `bin/slim-transcript.sh` truncates long lines, samples head+tail, and hard-caps total bytes. The L1 worker pre-slims any session over `AUTODREAM_SLIM_BYTES` (256 KB) before the haiku read, then rewrites the findings `session_path` back to the original. Sessions that previously errored ("exceeds token budget" — multi-MB transcripts with base64 images / giant tool outputs) now get triaged. Verified end-to-end: a 21 MB / 6463-line session slimmed to 205 KB / 603 lines and produced valid findings.
- **Docs.** `CLAUDE.md` (decisions, state layout, gotchas) and `codemaps/architecture.md` (data flow + file map), so the analysis behind this work is not re-derived next session.

### Changed
- **Lean-query invocation.** Both layers compose minimal-footprint flags from claude-cells `internal/claude/query.go` (`--tools <only-needed> --disable-slash-commands --strict-mcp-config --settings '{"disableAllHooks":true}'` + env `CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_CLAUDE_MDS=1`, etc.), cutting per-call tokens by dropping hooks/skills/MCP/CLAUDE.md while keeping subscription OAuth auth.

### Notes
- **Do not use `--bare` / `CLAUDE_CODE_SIMPLE`.** Verified they disable OAuth/keychain auth (require an API key) and limit tools to Bash+Edit; the composed flags above are the supported path for subscription users.
- Tests grew from 6 to 14 cases (changelog window, prune helper, self-session exclusion, L1 flaky retry, idempotency guard, self-audit stats, transcript slimming); all offline against the mock claude.

## 2026-05-29

### Fixed
- **Triage runner hardening.** L1 workers and the L2 aggregator received their paths as `KEY=value` text inlined into the prompt rather than as exported env vars, so any `$SESSION_PATH` / `$FINDINGS_DIR` the model emitted in a shell expanded to nothing and failed; the prompt was also assembled via `prompt=$(printf ...)`, whose trailing-newline strip glued the body onto the output-path line. Paths are now framed as literal absolute data with `$`-expansion explicitly forbidden in the system prompt, sessions are validated (`[ -r ]`) before dispatch, a worker that exits without writing JSON leaves a diagnostic `.json.err` (no more silent zero-byte file) and is left absent so a re-run retries, and the prompt is assembled via a brace-group pipe to preserve the blank-line separator before `SESSION_TRIAGE.md`.

### Added
- **Integration test suite.** `tests/run-all.sh` drives the real `bin/run.sh` end-to-end with `CLAUDE_BIN` pointed at `tests/mock-claude.sh` and the state/output dirs pointed at per-test fixtures — no network, no model calls. 20 assertions across 6 cases: happy path, unreadable-session validation, incomplete worker run (non-empty `.err`, no output, retriable), idempotent re-run, no-sessions stub, and a regression guard asserting the literal-path prompt framing. macOS only (BSD `date`/`touch`).

## 2026-05-26

### Added
- **Initial release: cc-autodream two-layer nightly review pipeline.** Layer 1 (haiku, fanned out one per session) reads yesterday's Claude Code session transcripts and emits structured findings JSON. Layer 2 (opus) aggregates into a ranked daily report and pin-marks high-confidence recurring findings into the relevant project's MEMORY.md. A morning `review.sh` launches an interactive Claude session preloaded with the report to walk through open questions one at a time. When cc-simple-memory is installed, the runner triggers a per-project `claude-memory gc` pass at the end so the consolidator can resettle around the new pins.
- **README FAQ + auto-dream contract alignment.** Restructured the comparison section into an FAQ answering the three questions a reader actually has, anchored in the leaked auto-dream source (`src/services/autoDream/`, `MAX_ENTRYPOINT_LINES = 200`, `MAX_ENTRYPOINT_BYTES = 25_000`), and linked out to claude-dream and cc-simple-memory for the janitor role. PROMPT.md updated so cc-autodream's pins honor the same 200/25KB/150-char index contract and four-type frontmatter taxonomy both consolidators use.

### Changed
- Dropped a fictional v5.3 version claim from the README.
