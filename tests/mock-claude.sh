# Mock `claude` binary for cc-autodream integration tests.
#
# run.sh invokes the real claude CLI for both layers. Here we stand in for it:
# read the prompt on stdin, find the two literal-path lines run.sh inlined, and
# write (or deliberately don't write) the expected output file — no model, no
# network. Which layer we are is decided by line 1 of the prompt.
#
# Env knobs (all optional):
#   MOCK_MODE=good           write findings (L1) / report (L2). [default]
#   MOCK_MODE=l1_incomplete  L1 writes nothing (simulates a worker that exits
#                            without producing JSON); L2 still writes its report.
#   MOCK_CAPTURE_DIR=<dir>   dump each layer's stdin + argv to <dir>/l{1,2}-*.txt
#                            so tests can assert on the exact prompt framing.
