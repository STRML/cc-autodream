# Tests for bin/cookie-cadence.sh, the #39 measurement pass.
#
# Drives the real script against fixture findings dirs. No network, no model calls, no
# credentials — the script only ever reads x-bookmarks.md headers and a file mtime.
#
# The whole script is one classification decision, and getting it wrong is not visible in
# the output: counting a network failure as an expiry makes a yearly chore read as a
# weekly one, and the number looks just as authoritative either way. So the fixtures pin
# each header shape the fetcher can actually write.
#
# Usage:  tests/cookie-cadence.sh
# Exit:   0 if every assertion passes, 1 otherwise.
